      <p>I grew up in Tokyo, and some of my favorite memories include eating street food like this dish with my friends.
        Although
        we now live thousands of miles apart, my friends and I still reminisce about our nights sharing secrets and
        bonding over
        delicious meals. This one is easy to re-create at home, which makes it perfect for when I'm feeling homesick. I
        like to
        serve it with rice. â€”Lindsay Howerton-Hastings, Greenville, South Carolina</p>

      <p>As the primary caregiver for my grandma, I am trying to cook healthier for her. I am fascinated with
        Mediterranean
        cuisine. It is much easier to have chicken and vegetables off the kabob, which inspired this sheet-pan dinner.

      <p>Green peppers and mint add a surprise to this Louisiana chicken recipe. A roasting bag keeps the chicken moist
        and
        flavorful.</p>
